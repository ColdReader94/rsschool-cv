- **Summary** (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).

**Skills:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass, JavaScript, Git, Babel, npm, Maven, Jenkins, Wordpress, Joomla, MySQL, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Flash, Figma

- **Code examples:**

- **Experience:** (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
